# Wheat Head Auto Counter
This is a free desktop wheat head counting tool that uses computer vision to detect and count wheat heads on images of wheat fields. Itâ€™s a flask app running on the desktop. Internally the app is powered by a Yolov5m model that was trained on data from the Global Wheat Head Dataset 2021.
